== About

A script to handle copying and pasting to local and remote clipboards without
the caller needing to worry about the platform. The only strict dependency is
`/bin/sh` (at least I hope so).

Inspiration taken from
* https://github.com/samoshkin/tmux-config.git
* https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9605/how-can-i-detect-if-the-shell-is-controlled-from-ssh

* https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/runtime/doc/provider.txt

== TODO list

* Add other backends, e.g.:
** `wl-copy` and `wl-paste`
** `lemonade`
** `doitclient`
** `win32yank`
* Testing
* Think about what else could be on this list
