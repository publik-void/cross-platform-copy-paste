== About

A script to handle copying and pasting to local and remote clipboards without
the caller needing to worry about the platform. The only strict dependency is
`/bin/sh` (at least I hope so, for now).

Inspiration taken from

* https://github.com/samoshkin/tmux-config.git
* https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9605/how-can-i-detect-if-the-shell-is-controlled-from-ssh
* https://sunaku.github.io/tmux-yank-osc52.html
* https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/runtime/doc/provider.txt

== TODO list

* Implement most `remote` commands through `ssh`
* A `cleanup` subcommand
* Programming style and correctness
** Go over function scoping
** Go over instances of command substitions re. quotes vs. no quotes
* Add other backends, e.g.:
** `wl-copy` and `wl-paste`
** `lemonade`
** `doitclient`
** `win32yank`
* Testing
** Consider special cases, such as
*** NUL character
* Any `TODO` marks in the script file
* Think about what else could be on this list
